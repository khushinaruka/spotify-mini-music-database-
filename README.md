# Spotify Mini (Music Database) 🎵

## 📌 Project Explanation  
This project, **Spotify Mini**, is a simplified version of a music streaming database created by **Khushi Naruka**.  
The main purpose of building this project is to **strengthen SQL skills** by working on a database that feels close to real-world applications like Spotify.  

The database is designed with four core tables: **Songs, Artists, Albums, and Playlists**. Together, they allow me to explore music-related insights such as trending songs, popular genres, user preferences, and top artists.  

## 🗂️ Database Schema  
- **Songs** → Stores details like title, duration, genre, artist, album, and play count  
- **Artists** → Contains artist information such as name, country, and followers  
- **Albums** → Includes album details like album name, release year, and artist  
- **Playlists** → Represents user-created playlists with name, user ID, and date  

## 🔍 Example Queries Implemented  
- Find the **most played song** in the database  
- Retrieve **songs by genre**  
- Identify a **user’s favorite artist** (based on play count)  
- Get all **albums by a specific artist**  

## 🚀 Use Case  
This project helps in analyzing **music trends and user behavior** while practicing SQL queries.  
It also demonstrates how relational databases can be structured for a real-world use case like a streaming service.  

## 📂 How I Used It  
1. Designed and created the schema for all tables.  
2. Inserted sample data to simulate songs, artists, albums, and playlists.  
3. Wrote queries to analyze data and extract insights.
